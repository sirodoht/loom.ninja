{"name":"Loom.ninja :: A story for electromagnetic people. Only.","tagline":"This is the legendary story of the first loom ninja: Sako","body":"## Present\r\nSpaceship battle. Red laser guns. Blue energy shields. Plasma bombs.\r\n\r\n## The beginning\r\nIt was a nice, warm and sunny evening in Hong Kong. Sako was excited since she had just made her first illegal order on Silk Road, and she was waiting to get Modafinil on her doorstep any day now.\r\n\r\n> Modafinil is a wakefulness drug developed in the 1980s.\r\n\r\nShe had seen *Limitless*, which, she claimed, hadn't had any effect on her decision to choose this drug.\r\n\r\n`-` \"You know, I never said it did\", said Patrick.\r\n\r\n`-` \"You didn't, but you thought of it; or were going to think it anyhow\".\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a bright, cold light appears in the room and a voice echoes.\r\n\r\n`-` \"Welcome, humans. This is Pages. We are a start-up located in the Andromeda Galaxy, and we would like to expand our lightbulb factory into a multi-galactic hisato.--\"\r\n\r\n`-` \"What the...?\", says Patrick while experiencing a feeling of supreme surprise.\r\nThe voice continues.\r\n\r\n`-` \"This is an automated intergalactic consumer analytics message and it would be awesome if you could make an extensive and verifiable research to answer the following questions: Do you think your market can support such industry? Is lightbulbing the everyday problem of many people in your neighbourhood? Do you believe your inferiors bulbs can work in subspace? And finally, what's your infrastructure for intergalactic communication. We use Matic Planets, and we would prefer having the same provider with you since we get 20k UTO/m free for other Matic customers.\"\r\n\r\n`-` \"Ha! Classic mistake! How could they ever be real and speak English?\", says Patrick.\r\n\r\n`-` \"After completing your research you can push the results into hi at pages dot hs dot andromeda. PS. This message costs very much. Please answer us soon using MPlanets. We understand there is an affiliated company there going by the name of *Joojle*. Cheers, Gen. gen at pages dot hs dot andromeda.\"\r\n\r\nThe light snaps away and voice stops.\r\n\r\nPatrick is phenomenally startled, while Sako remains speechless.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-54861632-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
