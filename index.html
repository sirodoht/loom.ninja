    <p>Spaceship battle. Red laser guns. Blue energy shields. Plasma bombs.</p>

    <h2>
      <a id="the-beginning" class="anchor" href="#the-beginning" aria-hidden="true">
        <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
      </a>The beginning</h2>

    <p>It was a nice, warm and sunny evening in Hong Kong. Sako was excited since she had just made her first illegal order on Silk Road, and she was waiting to get Modafinil on her doorstep any day now.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Modafinil is a wakefulness drug developed in the 1980s.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>She had seen
      <em>Limitless</em>, which, she claimed, hadn't had any effect on her decision to choose this drug.</p>

    <p>- "You know, I never said it did", said Patrick.</p>

    <p>- "You didn't, but you thought of it; or were going to think it anyhow".</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a bright, cold light appears in the room and a voice echoes.</p>

    <p>- "Welcome, humans. This is Pages. We are a start-up located in the Andromeda Galaxy, and we would like to expand our lightbulb factory into a multi-galactic hisato.--"</p>

    <p>- "What the...?", says Patrick while experiencing a feeling of supreme surprise. The voice continues.</p>

    <p>- "This is an automated intergalactic consumer analytics message and it would be awesome if you could make an extensive and verifiable research to answer the following questions: Do you think your market can support such industry? Is lightbulbing
      the everyday problem of many people in your neighbourhood? Do you believe your inferiors bulbs can work in subspace? And finally, what's your infrastructure for intergalactic communication. We use Matic Planets, and we would prefer having the same
      provider with you since we get 20k UTO/m free for other Matic customers."</p>

    <p>- "Ha! Classic mistake! How could they ever be real and speak English?", says Patrick.</p>

    <p>- "After completing your research you can push the results into hi at pages dot hs dot andromeda. PS. This message costs very much. Please answer us soon using MPlanets. We understand there is an affiliated company there going by the name of
      <em>Joojle</em>. Cheers, Gen. gen at pages dot hs dot andromeda."</p>

    <p>The light snaps away and voice stops.</p>

    <p>Patrick is phenomenally startled, while Sako remains speechless.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      That night Sako didn't sleep. She was searching the whole internet for references of Matic, Matic Planetsm, Pages as a Andromeda galaxy based startup and what's so special about lightbulbs.
    </p>

    <p>
      - "Seriously, dude. It's a hoax. First of all, why did they speak English. And second of all, there is no way Joojle is an alien company. Hardware hackers are EARTHLINGS!" said Patrick.
    </p>

    <p>
      - "First of all, and for the thousandth time this year, I am not a dude. And secondly: Can you even start to guess what this thing that we saw and heard could be, if not supreme alien tech? And what about Joojle? It is an awesome company, and it could be alien."
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Joojle is a world class hardware company who started few years ago providing hardware hackers with supreme debugging tools; true innovation at that time. Joojle also has real world physical spaces in various cities around the world. These are called open incubators, and are a blending between a hackerspace and a coworking space.
    </blockquote>

    <p>Joojle was respected by many people and companies. It had softly revolutionalized hardware hacking. Well, it was also the era for this kind of revolution anyway.</p>

    <p>Of the very few things that Joojle did bad, one was customer support. Or better, company-customer communication in general. Despite this unfortunate situation, our most competent character, Sako, was able to find some ways of communication between her and the Joojle people.</p>

    <p>The first thing she decided to do was to send one cold email to what she thought was the most appropriate person to handle her questions, Isaacs Roger, one of the founding members of Joojle and the most rockstar - and her favorite - employee.</p>

    <p>Before sending the email, she had decided to wait for at least day until the second - to a different person - unless new data come to light, a result of her unstoppably relentless research.</p>

    <p>Not an hour had passed, and she had an answer to her GMail. It was Isaacs.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Subject: Fucking hell!</p>

      <p>Nice to meet you Soka! This is awesome!</p>

      <p>Let's meet. Tomorrow, 3pm @ Is Cafe, Hong Kong Square. Bring your laptop too.</p>

      <p>
        - This is awesome,<br>
        Isaacs
      </p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Anyone could notice from Isaacs' interviews that he was an enthusiastic person. Such an answer, though, was beyond Sako's expectations. Although, she had not much time to think what she would expect.</p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      Tomorrow is here. 3pm is here. Sako is waiting very, very nervously near the door of the Is Cafe.
    </p>

    <p>
      3:01. "Fuck. He's not coming.", she thinks.
    </p>

    <p>
      "What if he doesn't come? What then? How will he even appear here. In front of all these people? Everyone will recognize him, it would be impossible to meet and talk discreetly. How could I not have foreseen this?! It's obvious. So he won't come. And he could predict that I could predict this. So, this means that he knows that I know that he will not come. Which means that...? We won't meet? Why would he even bother emailing? Is he being spied on? No, it would be a fail even then, since the hypothesized spy could and would also predict that he would not appear daylight on a famous cafe. So, what does this mean then? It's a test for me! I should find out what to do next, and this may be expected. So, should I find something here, or something in his message. Why did he say that I should bring my laptop. OK - zoom out and step back. Most logical assumptions: he was not spied on, which means he didn't lie (?), which means he meant that we will meet. But we can also safely assume we will not meet. Which means thaaaat, I need to do or find my next clue here. Oh! Is that him?! Yeap. Nevermind then!"
    </p>

    <p>
      Isaacs walks towards Sako. She just smiles and watches him getting closer to her.
    </p>

    <p>
      - "Hello Sako! You're Sako, right?".
    </p>

    <p>
      - "Yes. Yes, that's me. We talked... - emailed! I sent you the email, you know. You know?", she tried to order her thoughts.
    </p>

    <p>
      - "Haha! Yes, of course. Let's find a table, first!"
    </p>

    <p>The best cafe table decision algorithm is to sit in the first table you see. Then you ask yourself: "Is there something bad with this table, chairs, or whatever else can be changed by switching tables?". If so, then you go to the next table you see. If not, obviously, the algorithms has come to an end successfully.</p>

    <p>
      Right at that moment, two thoughts were crossing Sako's mind.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. Why, the fuck, doesn't everyone recognize him?
    </p>

    <p>
      2. At which table should we fucking sit?!
    </p>

    <p>
      Thankfully, both of these questions had reasonables answers. Let's start with the most obvious: sit at the first table you see. Moving on to why no one recognized him.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since this is the second in order thought in Sako's mind, it took a while for her to solve it. The answer starts with the question: "Why should everyone recognize him?". The answer to this second question is that they shouldn't, because as it turns out, you wouldn't know his face unless you are quite interested to see one of his interviews or his introductions at the prestiged Joojle events. And most people weren't.
    </p>

    <p>
      - "What about here?", Isaacs asks, pointing to the first table he saw when he came in.
    </p>

    <p>
      - "Sure.", Sako answers.
    </p>
